## Windows 64
NOTE: WINDOWS 64 IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY MICROSOFT PRODUCTS!
Windows 64 is a creepy-themed parody-esque web rendition (thats a mouthful) of Windows 98/95.
This project was created for Siege Week 9, with the theme of 'Spooky'.
Please note that the Run dialog does not work and the Run window straight up doesnt show up at all - I'm sorry for this, I couldn't fix it.
Without furtherado, I hope you like my project!
